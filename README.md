# Assembly Numbers

This is the base work for the tools I am developing as an aid to my work. This work is developed with GNU Assembly Syntax, for the x86_64 Mac OS processor family.

### Problems to solve
- calculate a number out of other three (rule of three) [cite repo](#)
- grow or shrink many numbers proportionally. [cite repo](#)

### Goal
- Learn Assembly language with GNU syntax
- Understand the difficulties of low level programming
- Integrate low level with higher level tools (UI tests in C)
- Learn how to notify GitHub about the health of the new commit (Status API)
- Make repository dependencies: this repo is a common library to the tools that solve the problems listed above
